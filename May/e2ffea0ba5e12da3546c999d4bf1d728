Now, we are afraid, and we want help from the police and also from the community. We are not feeling safe so we want the visibility of the police next to the clinic everyday. If that can happen, we believe incidents like these won t happen again, she said.Resident Thembile Makana said, How many people do we want to see dead before we report these criminals? Why are we hiding them while we can identify them? Let s unite and fight these criminals.
