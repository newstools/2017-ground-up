The Cape Town Minstrel Carnival also known as Tweede Nuwe Jaar is celebrated annually on 2 January. The colourful costumes, face paint, music and comical dancing bring this unique Cape Town event to life. Many thousands of people perform in the parade in one of city s biggest tourist attractions.The face painting process involves four steps. First, is the base coat, then some colour, then a brush is used to do the details, and finally glitter is added.At Adiel Adams s home in Athlone, minstrels from numerous teams (or troupes) start arriving from as early as 5am to get their faces painted. The Adams family have been doing this for over a decade. The work is done by Adiel, his two sons Eesa (17), Zubair (23) and Shafiek Salie. It s a passion of mine. I love it and I was brought up into this, says Adiel.
