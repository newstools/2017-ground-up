On Wednesday, the City of Cape Town announced a new plan for future affordable housing developments. All of the sites are within 5km of the city centre and have good access to public transport. The City estimates that the final developments should benefit at least 4,000 lower-income households. The Woodstock Hospital site is among the areas marked for development. Housing activist Zackie Achmat wrote on his Facebook page: “Today, a real thank you to Mayor Patricia de Lille and Mayoral Committee member Brett Herron. … No negativity from comrades today. Celebrate your own role in this.”
