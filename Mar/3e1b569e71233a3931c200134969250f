Seven of them were juveniles and were dealt with in terms of Child Justice Act . She did not respond to follow-up questions about the handgun.GroundUp is awaiting a response from Nyanga station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata.Selekwa said trouble started when around ten residents held a counter protest to stop protesting teachers and students from entering the high school grounds.Police intervened, firing rubber bullets at the students. The students threw bricks and stones. After they were dispersed, students made their way to the Philippi train station to regroup.Students debated whether to go home or go to the police station and press charges against the counter protesters, according to Selekwa.Tyres were burnt on the railway lines and police again used stun grenades and rubber bullets. This is when the alleged handgun incident took place.Students then made their way to the main road and blocked a section of the R300 between Mitchells Plain and Samora. The students were once again dispersed with rubber bullets.Mandisa Nora Cenga, the school principal, said the school was operating.
