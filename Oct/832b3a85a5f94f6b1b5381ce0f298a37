 The case of the eviction of families in Albert Road in Woodstock was postponed in the Cape Town Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, pending settlement negotiations. The residents of a block converted into apartments were served with eviction notices in March and April to vacate their homes after not paying rent. They say they stopped paying rent after their water was cut more than a year ago. The landlord’s lawyer, Ahmed Ebrahim, has disputed their version. The City of Cape Town submitted a report to the court about alternative accommodation for the residents. Outside the court, the residents’ lawyer, Mark Owen, told GroundUp he hoped to meet with representatives of the City to discuss a possible settlement. In an email to GroundUp, Mayoral Committee Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services; and Energy, Xanthea Limberg, said the City had offered alternative accommodation at the Delft Symphony Way Temporary Relocation Area (Blikkiesdorp) and/or Wolwerivier. But Owen reiterated statements by the residents, who have said they do not want to go to Wolwerivier or Blikkiesdorp, which are far away. The case was postponed to 22 November.
