I arrived at Nyanga Junction at about 7:20am this morning. A woman told me that the previous train had come at 6:30am. This is rush hour on a Friday morning. At about 7:50am a train arrived. I shot the video below. What you see here is not unusual. Delays are the norm and the overcrowding you see in the video is typical.
