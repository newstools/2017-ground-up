Sources close to former finance minister Pravin Gordhan have confirmed today that he will speak at Ahmed Kathrada s memorial service in Cape Town on Thursday.The service, to be held at Saint George s Cathedral, comes a week and a half after the ANC stalwart s death on 28 March, and a week since President Jacob Zuma s cabinet reshuffle on 30 March. This gathering is a moment for civil society and Cape Town residents to organise and adopt a program for mass action. We demand that Parliament is recalled, and that it tables a vote of no confidence against President Zuma. We demand that the nuclear deal is scrapped, organisers said in a WhatsApp message earlier today.Kathrada s service will be held from 2pm to 3:30pm. It is supported by the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation.Endorsing organizations include:
