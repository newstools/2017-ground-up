GroundUp has retracted an earlier article about money lender Ukuvuya Financial Services, owned by Fast Cash. We had been told by National Credit Regulator spokespersons Lebogang Selibi and Rishana Singh that neither Ukuvuya nor Fast Cash were registered with the NCR. However NCR senior registration officer Ishmael Molekoa later told GroundUp that Fast Cash is indeed registered and trades as Ukuvuya Financial Services. GroundUp regrets the error, which was due to incorrect information supplied by the NCR.
