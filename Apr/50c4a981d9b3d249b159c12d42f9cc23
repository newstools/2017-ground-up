Although we are in the 21st Century and make up more than half of the world s population, it s still difficult for women to contribute to innovation and discoveries. When you have women being equal partners in science, there will be a synergy and the value of work done will be substantial, she said.Dr Hannah Motshedisi Sebitloane, Head of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that science has made a significant contribution in the morbidity and mortality rates of babies in South Africa. We have come a long way with HIV prevention and treatment, and science has allowed today to have 1 out of 100 babies born with HIV as opposed to the days before advanced science and technology where it was 33 out of 100, she said.Professor Jerry Coovadia said: We re here to remind people how essential science is for disease and even social cohesion.
