For months 88-year-old Emily Pukujoe has been appealing for help without any success after the roof of her home burned down.When it rains, water pours into Pukujoe s home in Imbali, Pietermaritzburg. A pensioner who is partially blind, she says she is afraid to be alone in the house since the fire. Her only family is a blind grandchild who does not live with her.Her neighbour checks up on her everyday after work.Remembering the fire last year, Pukujoe said she had been preparing to go to sleep at about 7pm when the light bulb went off. She lit a small piece of candle, which she says she extinguished carefully before going to bed. But she woke to see flames. I couldn t walk or see properly. I screamed at the top of my voice and my neighbours came to see what was happening. Everything in my bedroom was burning. I managed to reach for my ID. It was important that I at least save my ID for my grant. In the blink of an eye the other room and my bathroom were in flames. When it rains, water pours inside and I always wake up in a pool of water. The wind is my worst fear, said Pukujoe. I m appealing for help to anyone who can help me fix at least the roof. The winter season is approaching and I m scared of the cold and danger, said Pukujoe.One of the neighbours who asked not be named said the previous ward councillor had visited the house and promised to help but he had since died. All we want is for gogo to get help, said the neighbour.Ward 15 councillor Jabulani Nene said he was aware of Pukujoe s situation and was trying to get help for her.
