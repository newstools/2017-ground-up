Other participants in the event included student leaders, campus protection services and delegates from the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority.On Thursday afternoon, student leaders wanted to address the summit, claiming they weren t given an adequate explanation as to why national ministers who were scheduled to speak Fikile Mbalula (police), Blade Nzimande (higher education and training) and Angie Motshekga (basic education) were absent.Minister Mbalula was scheduled to open the summit on Wednesday morning, while the education ministers were scheduled to speak on Thursday morning.Minister for Women in the Presidency Susan Shabangu was scheduled to speak on Friday morning.
