 Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans in KwaZulu-Natal held a march to highlight the plight of black farm workers. The demonstration was a reaction to the recent #BlackMonday protests by farmers against farm murders. The march blocked traffic and trucks on the N3 from 9am till noon at the Mariannhill toll plaza in Pinetown near Durban, the busiest toll gate in KZN. The veterans used the old South African flag to wipe passing cars, later burning it. “We are burning the old South Africa, it will never rise again,” said one veteran. Themba Mavundla, KwaZulu-Natal chairperson of the veterans said, “It is a direct response to #BlackMonday that was painted with a false perception that all farmers killed are white, while it was blatantly clear that it was a movement against the current ruling government. The Boers are yearning that the old days return and we’re responding to that. If they want the current government to fall, it will only do so democratically.” “It became very clear on #BlackMonday that the rainbow nation is fake. Now we’ve got a duty to build a new one ourselves,” he said. Present at the march was Langa Dube, grandson of John Langalibalele Dube (founder of the organisation that became the ANC). He said, “We chose the Toll Plaza to create an impact, especially to the white capitalists who own farms and these trucks. We want to upset the economy.” The veterans handed the memorandum demanding a commission of inquiry into the plight of farm workers to Dr Nonhlanhla Mkhize, Regional Director-General of KwaZulu-Natal.
