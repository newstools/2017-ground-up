 With constant delays and a lack of trains currently on Metrorail services in Cape Town, unaccompanied melodies sung by a group of youngsters come as a welcome respite for some frustrated commuters. Ntsikelelo Booi (13), Cwenga Yawa (13), Vuyani Booi (18) and Endinako Bokolo (16) are part of a nine-member group called 2K Melodies. On weekends, they busk and entertain passengers with unaccompanied songs on trains from Khayelitsha. The aspiring young artists live in Delft and Lower Philippi. They go to Phandulwazi High School in Lower Crossroads. They rehearse during school breaks. All the songs they perform are cover versions of popular South African hits, such as Vura by Sjava and Wololo by Babes Wodumo. They also sing struggle songs such as Senzeni nah? (What have we done?)
